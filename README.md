# Distance-of-person-from-machine
This project detects the face of the person through pre built model haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is a haar cascade designed by OpenCV to detect the frontal face.

The co ordinates of the face is calculated using this model.

If the person is coming towards the machine then the computer says" You are coming close" and if the person is going away from the machine then the machine says" You are going far"

Hence this project also works on text to speech.

Text to speech is implemented through the library pyttsx3.

The code is given with all the requirements.
